# Automate Monkeytype

> A program to automate typing on [_Monkeytype_](https://monkeytype.com/).

## General Information

Monkeytype is a minimalistic, customisable typing website. This project automates the typing. Just for fun üòÅ.

## Technologies Used

* PyAutoGUI - version 0.9.54
* Selenium - version 4.11.2
  
## Setup

The requirements for this project are listed above.  
To install these libraries to your local environment run the following installation commands in you terminal;

* `pip3 install pyautogui`
* `pip3 install selenium`
  
You will also need a WebDriver specific for the browser. You can get the WebDriver for your browser [_here_](https://learndataanalysis.org/download-browser-drivers-selenium-with-python/). This website contains the link to all the supported WebDrivers.

It would be better if you kept the WebDriver executable file in the project folder rather than adding it to the PATH.
